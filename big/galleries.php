<p>Visual design is an important element in website design. Large blocks of text can often scare visitors before they read the content. Consequently, graphics and images are extremely important elements of any website, whether they are used to illustrate text, to create personal or emotional connections with users, or to visualize the details of the product. According to IONOS Digitalguide, “Galleries are a popular way of integrating images into a website, allowing users to see several images clearly at once. There are several diverse methods of generating slide shows such as these, including embedding a simple Lightbox gallery in your website with a source code and implementing the photo gallery via HTML. Another, even simpler method involves using a popular content management system. To do this with a system like TYPO3 or WordPress, users just need to find the right extension and integrate it into the basic framework”(Web design).</p>
<p>Adding an HTML photo gallery to your site will not only make your page more attractive but will also engage your visitors and increase the time they spend on page. Mihaela Lica Butler noted that “When it comes to websites, images matter because their role is to capture the attention of the visitor. They can convey complex messages in the blink of an eye. Looking at the image of a hotel room, the site visitor can see the décor of the room and some of its amenities without the need of reading lengthy descriptions immediately. Relevant images – instead of “filler” images that only have the purpose to look pretty – enhance the user experience. They deliver a contextual message, which answers the need for information. Naturally, when guests visit the website of a hotel, they are looking for information and images deliver it quickly and explicitly. An image gallery optimized for stress-free browsing is another UX plus”(Butler).</p>
<p>There are many ways as well as many templates to create an HTML gallery. One of the easiest ways to present images on a web page is to create a lightbox gallery. Lightbox is programmed in Javascript as dynamic HTML. When the user clicks on the preview image, that image opens in a larger format as the website fades out in the background. This Lightbox type can be easily embedded into a web page and extended with other functions. To create a gallery, the user requires the current Lightbox version and all images must be embedded in the web page. According to  IONOS Digitalguide, “The first version of Lightbox was developed by Lokesh Dhakar in 2005 and the script became available under a Creative Commons License a short while later. Since then, the popular script has released several new versions and updates, including both standalone scripts and plugins for JavaScript libraries and extensions for content management systems”(Web Design)
