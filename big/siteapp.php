<p>With more than 3.5 billion smartphone users worldwide, businesses recognized the importance of adapting to mobile devices. Understanding responsive websites or mobile apps will help you be able to choose what is more preferable to you or which one is more appropriate for your business. Both the responsive website and the mobile app have their advantages and disadvantages, and it is important to understand these in detail before committing to a specific development path. Mobile apps work differently than responsive websites. They don't run on all devices and need to be installed separately but what they give is unique user experience. While your website is aimed at attracting new or occasional clients your mobile app works with regular clients(Babich).</p>
<p>A responsive website is available for all users who have internet connection. It doesn’t require downloading or installation. Regardless of operating system, you can easily use a responsive website on your smartphone. Oppositely, mobile apps can’t run on a device with a different operating system. For example, if you want your app to run on both iOS and Android, you need to develop two versions of your app. However, Once the app has been downloaded, It can work offline. its data can be stored directly on a device. The product team can decide which content it wants to make available for offline use(Korol)</p>
<p>Besides, the responsive website is less expensive and easier to maintain. According to Viktor Korol, “The site is easy for updating, supporting and bug fixing. On the opposite to mobile apps, a user doesn’t have to install the new version to see the enhancements on the website. For the most part, users don’t even notice the process of updating. They can simply enjoy the renewed product. At the same time, it is easier and cheaper for an owner to update one website”(Korol).</p>
<p>On the other hand, mobile apps focus on special features and functions. Nick Babich noted that “There’s consistency with OS design. Native apps act like the rest of the user experiences on the phone—both visual design decisions and interaction patterns will be familiar for your target audience. As a result, they will spend less time learning how to use your product”(Babich).</p>
<p>Mobile apps also can leverage a mobile device’s hardware-control features. According to Viktor Korol, “Mobile app works better with hardware sensors like microphone, camera, GPS, etc., that improves acting with a device and makes the user's life easier. So that you can get access to different phone options like calls or geolocation just with a few taps” (Korol).</p>
