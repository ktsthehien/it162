<p>Nowadays when people demand easiness in everything, an online shopping cart becomes a good choice to reach customers and sell products. It is a software that allows your customers to shop products from your website. According to Randa Kriss, “An online shopping cart, or e-commerce shopping cart, is the software that allows customers to shop on a website. Online shopping cart systems typically include a full range of e-commerce capabilities, including store building, payment processing and customer management tools. Unlike a physical shopping cart, an e-commerce shopping cart can involve a variety of components and can function differently depending on the system you use.”(Kriss).

<p>Online shopping cart plays a substantial role in converting your online store visitors into customers. Christianna Cannon noted that “ Shoppers consider shopping carts as a place where they can see and place their desired products before actually paying it. They choose to purchase a product from your store. They need to determine whether the product is suitable for them or not.A shopping cart is a medium for online store owners to maintain a customer’s purchase journey and buying decision. Based on it, owners can come to know what attracts their customers and what is stopping them from buying a specific product. They can analyze many issues and propose a suitable solution for the customer” (Cannon).</p>
<p>There are many ways to add a shopping cart to your website without changing your existing design. If you're comfortable working with HTML code, you can add products directly to any page on your site as you see fit. Or You can add an online store catalog that works alongside your website and connect it to your main website with very little modification to your original website (Cannon).</p>
<p>An easiest way to add a shopping cart to a website is to use a hosted SaaS eCommerce platform to build an online store. By doing it this way, you won't have to alter your original website beyond adding a link to access the store section. According to Randa Kriss, a few of the best e-commerce shopping cart options for small businesses are: Shopify, 3dcart, Weebly, OpenCart, PrestaShop, and WooCommerce ( Kriss).
